Write down the objective functions of ANN's with different criteria as follows:

(1)sum of squared errors (referred to the slides)  + regularized term

(2) cross entropy

(3) cross entropy + regularized term

 

Then, show the back-propagation solutions and  run the experiments (the same data as KNN)accordingly.
